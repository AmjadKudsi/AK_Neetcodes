## Description
This repository contains my code implementations for DSA practice.

## Question 1: Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

[Solution](https://github.com/AmjadKudsi/AK_Neetcodes/blob/main/Question%201%3A%20Contains%20Duplicate)

## Question 2: Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

## Question 3: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
